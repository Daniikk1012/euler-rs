# Project Euler solutions in Rust

This repo uses [`sbvc`] version control system to keep track of `src/main.rs`
file. This is a singe-file version control system developed for use cases
similar to this.

[`primter`] crate is also used for some problems, which require working with
prime numbers. This crate provides an implementation of a prime number iterator.
